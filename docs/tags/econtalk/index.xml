      <description>Intro I first got to know Dr. Munger on YouTube(Why Major in Political Science?) when I wanted to decide between going to Law school &amp;amp; studying Political Science back in 2021. Though I was persuaded by the guy to do so and he influenced me for the rest of my life with his Germany stories, and his BMW car, I decided to go to Law school for better job status. Anyways, his ideas on constitutions have always been fascinating.</description>
